pseudocode - intake

1 motor
1 servo
color sensor/ distance (2)



auto purple pixel
- the motor doesn't move during mount, but when the camera identifies the correct pos:
- move and orient robot to corresponding spikes

- slow motor, reverse




roller based:

- the robot follows automatic path as coded, then a color sensor detects an available stack:
- motor starts

scenario 1: assume the stacks are stacked as they should be:
- a button press lowers the roller in an increment, or raises
- simple overall


auto:
- assuming we can’t tell how many pixels are stacked:
- the intake drives down the stack, then the other sensor commands the motor to cease when two pixels pass through
  assuming we can tell how many pixels are stacked:
- the intake just goes down a max of two increments, then ‘stops’
- motor stops

teleop:
- the robot’s intake goes down in increments, and hopefully the driver’s at least
- smart enough to know to stop after two increments


scenario 2: the stacks aren’t stacked as they should be; they’re disoriented
- not complicated, just make sure auto works properly

auto:

- the intake drives down the stack, then the other sensor
- commands the motor to cease when two pixels pass through

- the robot’s intake goes down in increments, and hopefully the
- driver’s at least smart enough to know to stop after two increments

teleop:
- same as scenario 1
