Turn on and set up camera beforehand (init)
Initialize odometry object (init)
Determine location of spike mark indicator using camera locations or color sensor to determine where the spike mark line is (init, ~1-2 seconds)
Go to spike mark (~0.5 seconds)
Call the motors in reverse intake to put pixel on spike mark indicator
Continue to use odometry and camera/april tags to get the backdrop (~4 seconds)
Using lift motor on higher set lines, use end effector servo to drop the pixel(preloaded) before coming back (~1 second)
Intake the white pixels in the stacks(2 maximum)
Align with spike mark
Intake pixel
Lower intake
Intake pixel
Drive back to the board using odometry and camera/april tags (similar to step 6)
Use lift motor(2) and end effectors servos and end effectors color sensor to position the white pixels on the correct spot, before using the servo to drop the pixel
Repeat 3-4 cycles (steps 6 to 8)
Using odometry, park in the backdrop area and turn off all motors (~1 seconds)
