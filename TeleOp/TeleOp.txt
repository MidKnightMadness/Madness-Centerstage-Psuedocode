Mosaic: Identify Color of pixel below where you are placing and color of pixel
Intake two of the stacked pixels
Go to Backdrop
Detect April Tag
Used to align
Align
Adjust motor to align and pixels on color sensors to make mosaic/end effect

Out take pixel on top of same colored pixel
Or on new column to start new mosaic



35 pixels by making mosaic: 
Go to stack
Intake and identify two pixels each time
Go to backdrop
Align
Adjust motor to align and pixels on color sensors to make mosaic/end effect
Servo to outtake pixel
Cycle process

Cycle white (If time/pixels are left):
Intake 2 white pixel
Go to backdrop
